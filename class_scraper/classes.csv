Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Lecture and  1 to 2 hour of Discussion per week for 15 weeks. ,Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell&#44; metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation&#44; transportation&#44; pollution&#44; energy services&#44; and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints&#44; weak institutions&#44; and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover&#44; democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic&#44; but present challenges with respect to priority setting&#44; coordination&#44; and corruption.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of lecture per week. ,Ideals of good governance are a core concern of many brands of traditional Chinese thought. The image of the ruler whose authority is exercised in harmony with the desires and interests of the society at large plays a key role not only in theories of governance but also in thought about ethics and psychology. There is also a fascination with the bad ruler. In addition to serving as negative examples just as good rulers serve as positive examples&#44; bad rulers also provide an imaginative space for thinking about extremes of human will&#44; offering an outlet for fantasy and vicarious gratification of desires that normally remain taboo.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,4 hours of Lecture per week for 15 weeks. ,This class is designed to help students explore the political dimensions of finanical crises. To do so we will study the behavior of the financial elites&#44; and the dynamic system of rules&#44; norms&#44; markets&#44; and organizations that constitute the political environment of international finance. We will examine the current global financial crisis in comparative and historical perspective. Our inquiry will include an intellectual dialogue with the work of theorists&#44; market participants&#44; and policymakers. How can we prevent another financial catastrophe? What should we do about banks that are "too big to fail"? Will I be able to find a job when I graduate? What can the IMF do to help developing countries cope? How will U.S.-China diplomatic relations be impacted? Is U.S. financial hegemony slowly relegating itself to the dustbin of history? Is the current policy response adequate or are we merely creating another bubble? The Global Financial Crisis is on everyone's minds.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,4 hours of Lecture per week for 15 weeks. ,World leaders at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Copenhagen this past December announced that they reached "a meaningful agreement" that will lead to a global treaty to address climate change. Many observers see the politics of the Copenhagen Accord as a glimpse into the new world order in which international diplomatic power will increasingly be shared by the United States (U.S.) and emerging powers&#44; such as China. Climate change policy also offers a lens through which the U.S. domestic environmental policymaking process can be viewed and its evolution better understood. This course will examine the dynamics of global environmental treaty-making after first studying the development of U.S. environmental protection efforts. Students will then analyze the international and domestic efforts that led up to the Copenhagen Accord and assess what is needed and likely to result from the next UNFCCC meeting to be held in Mexico City in 2010.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Lecture and  1 hour of Discussion per week for 15 weeks.  6 hours of Lecture and  1.5 hours of Discussion per week for 8 weeks. ,This course is designed to provide a dual chronological and thematic approach to the study of one of the greatest empires in human civilization: the Mughal Empire. Although the bulk of this course will focus on the Mughal Empire during its heyday between the 1550s and the early 1700s&#44; careful attention will be paid to the larger historical and geographical contexts that both enabled the emergence and&#44; ultimately&#44; decentralization of Mughal power. In so doing&#44; this course will not only study South Asia's complex history on its own terms but also examine the intricate web of political&#44; economic&#44; and social links that connected South Asia to the rest of the world. Simultaneously&#44; this course will also pay particular attention to a series of common misconceptions that dog the study of pre-modern Islamic polities. Among them&#44; the supposedly lesser role played by women in politics; the dogmatic and central role of Islam in "Muslim" states; and the economic and political superiority of Western Europe. Crucial to these questions also is an examination of the historiography and historiographical traditions that have come to define contemporary understanding of the Mughal Empire.

In so doing&#44; we will interrogate the historical trajectory and development of religious nationalism from the colonial period through to the present. We will examine issues relating to the rise of (non-religious) nationalism outside of South Asia; Hindu and Muslim relations in the pre-colonial period; colonial attempts to construct South Asia's past along religious lines; the dialectical interplay of early Hindu and Muslim religious nationalism; the interplay between secular and religious nationalism; different intellectual attempts to articulate notions of bounded religious communities; the success of religious nationalism in contemporary South Asia; and the implications of religious nationalism for the future of South Asia.

It seeks to make students conversant in the key texts and philosophical innovations of yoga across time. But to better convey the complex nuances of yoga's historical development it approaches the subject in three parts: it explores theories of origin leading up to the formation of yoga as a classical philosophical school; it focuses on specialists and medieval innovators as it examines sects&#44; sadhus&#44; and aberrant modes of practice; it explores the contemporary context as it investigates modern yoga's place in both popular imagination and the marketplace.

Undergrad Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS),171,The Middle East Conflict in Living Color and the American Civil War on Stage,3 Units,Undergrad Interdisciplinary Studies,Undergraduate,Fall and spring,Letter grade. Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Lecture per week for 15 weeks. ,Over the past four years&#44; this course has canvassed the Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of politically and socially attuned material on DC stages. Washington has&#44; rather suprisingly&#44; emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation&#44; surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered&#44; audience in attendance&#44; and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical&#44; flagship&#44; and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted at the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile: that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet often times&#44; theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for&#44; or the critical community that critiques them&#44; or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portaits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons?.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Lecture per week for 15 weeks. ,This course explores museums as dynamic sites of intellectual and cultural debate&#44; and as institutions vested with the authority to define aesthetics&#44; history&#44; heritage&#44; and even citizenship. Now more than ever&#44; as the process of globalization raises questions about the fluidity&#44; preservation&#44; and "authenticity" of culture&#44; museums of all kinds are attracting great interest both as places to visit and as a subject of critical analysis in their own right. As places defined by the collection&#44; display&#44; and interpretation of objects&#44; museums are bound up in questions of permanence and transience&#44; difference and identity&#44; equity and privilege--issues that lie at the heart of what is termed the "new museology." But as institutional repositories of community memory or indigenous knowledge&#44; they are also bound up in questions of representation&#44; access and ownership--issues that move the debate over museum collections squarely into the politics of local&#44; state&#44; and national control over heritage. If ownership and control are the new realities of international heritage policy (and law)&#44; museums have quickly emerged as important sites on which and through which these claims are being made.

The implications of viewing individuals as equal and endowed with certain rights is potentially far reaching as in the declaration that individuals hold many of those rights irrespective of the views of their government. Yet&#44; we also live in a world of sovereign states with sovereign state's rights. We see everyday a clash between the rights of the individual and lack of duty to fulfill those rights when an individual's home state is unwilling or unable to do so. After introducing the idea of human rights&#44; its historic development and various international human rights mechanisms&#44; this course will ask what post-World War II conceptions of human rights mean for a number of specific issues including humanitarian intervention&#44; international criminal justice&#44; U.S. foreign policy&#44; immigration&#44; and economic rights. Looking in-depth at these five areas&#44; we will ask how ideas about human rights&#44; laws about human rights&#44; and institutions to protect human rights have on how states and other global actors act&#44; and how individuals have fared.

Is the skeptic right to answer: nothing? What is it in the nature of minds (and bodies) which makes knowledge seem so problematic? How are minds and bodies related to those things which have them: persons? And how does this bear on the question of the meaning of life?.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,4 hours of Lecture per week for 15 weeks.  10 hours of Lecture per week for 6 weeks. ,Antebellum American political history generally follows a routine script in which the purpose of the Revolution was to liberate Americans for self-government and economic and social development. Slavery is viewed as an anomaly still needing explanation&#44; and Native American relocation as the consequence of natural forces of immigration and pre-modern social values. In this class&#44; the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown&#44; the rise of slavery&#44; and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in the 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials&#44; including biographies&#44; history&#44; and literature&#44; and contemporary images from American popular culture such as film&#44; news and magazine articles&#44; and music&#44; we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans&#44; Euopean immigrants&#44; and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.

How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory&#44; institutionalism&#44; Marxism&#44; and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979&#44; and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power&#44; structure and agency&#44; and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments. This course has a required discussion section.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,5 hours of Lecture per week for 8 weeks. ,This course will examine the foundation of science and technology studies. Our methodology will be borrowed from critical theory and the philosophical movements upon which critical theory itself depends. The reading will be directed toward understanding those texts which form the theoretical and methodological basis for a critical theory of science and technology. The great success of science in proliferating technology into the larger sphere of modern western society has for the most part legitimated its approach and claims to be the method of attaining knowledge&#44; at least within our own techno-scientific culture. Along with science's accomplishments&#44; however&#44; have come new questions as to the potential of the knowledge it brings&#44; the technology it engenders and the power it carries. Technology is one of the means by which science proceeds&#44; but perhaps more importantly it is the juncture between science and society as well as theory and praxis. This course will investigate the means by which writers have reflected upon science and technology.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,4s hours of lecture/discussion per week. 7.5 hours of lecture/discussion per week for 8 weeks. 10 hours of lecture/discussion per week for 6 weeks. ,This interdisciplinary course is an introduction to the complex interplay of transnational values&#44; international rights and legal institutions that increasingly govern social&#44; cultural and geopolitical interactions in our contemporary world. Theoretical and methodological tools from the social sciences&#44; jurisprudence&#44; and philosophy will be applied im the analyses of these interplays. A study of rights and norms presupposes not only an understanding of the empirical evolution of rights traditions (including constitutional traditions) in a variety of global regions&#44; but also an understanding of the theories of rights and laws that support such traditions as they are embedded in them (just war theories&#44; peace theories&#44; etc.) The study of rights and norms also requires an exploration of the transformations of crucial international norms and rights due to the formation of supranational institutions and organizations in the 20th century (UN&#44; UNESCO&#44; GO's&#44; etc.). The course will provide the students with an opportunity to place emerging transnational rights institutions into a historical and geopolitical framework.

Our stress will be on post-Marxist works of analysis. The initial focal point will be on the work of Max Weber and Joseph Schumpeter&#44; as well as important current debates in economic history and social theory generated by their work. Both Weber and Schumpeter display a strong fascination and elaboration with the work of Marx. The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system. We will also consider a number of current efforts that look at the systemic nature of capitalism. In particular&#44; we are interested in how economic historians now see the development of capitalism. We also want to examine the Weberian tradition in terms of the role of culture in shaping economic behavior. Debates about the nature of globalization will also be considered as well as analysis of the changing nature of work.

As urban populations swell&#44; metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation&#44; transportation&#44; pollution&#44; energy services&#44; and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints&#44; weak institutions&#44; and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover&#44; democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic&#44; but present challenges with respect to priority setting&#44; coordination&#44; and corruption.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Lecture and  1 to 2 hour of Discussion per week for 15 weeks. ,Over half of the world's population is now urban. As urban populations swell&#44; metropolitan areas in both the developed and the developing world struggle to provide basic services and address the negative externalities associated with rapid growth. Sanitation&#44; transportation&#44; pollution&#44; energy services&#44; and public safety typically fall to sub-national governments. Yet local sub-national institutions face difficulties as they tackle these challenges because development tends to spill over political boundaries and resources are limited. Such difficulties are particularly acute in the developing world due to tighter resource constraints&#44; weak institutions&#44; and the comparative severity of the underlying problems. Moreover&#44; democratization and decentralization suggest that urban governance and service delivery may have become more democratic&#44; but present challenges with respect to priority setting&#44; coordination&#44; and corruption.

Yet few of us pay attention to its distinctive traits and to its effects beyond our borders. California may be "a state of mind&#44;" but it is also the most dynamic place in the most powerful country in the world&#44; and would be the 5th largest economy if it were a country. Its wealth has been built on mining&#44; agriculture&#44; industry&#44; trade&#44; and finance. Natural abundance and geographic advantage have played their parts&#44; but the state's greatest resource has been its wealth and diversity of people&#44; who have made it a center of technological and cultural innovation from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. Yet California has a dark side of exploitation and racialization of many peoples&#44; and of violent efforts to exclude immigrants and control the poor. This course pursues classic themes in geography&#44; such as regional difference&#44; the transformation of nature&#44; the space of cities&#44; and the changing landscape.

How societies organize work shapes the distribution of rewards and power&#44; not just in the workplace but in society at large. Everyone's work is profoundly shaped by the way it connects to other people's labor around the globe. Using a variety of disciplinary lenses&#44; we will look at working people world wide and examine how the organized efforts of working people have shaped the nature of jobs and social change.

Every discipline taught in the College of Letters & Science has ethical implications&#44; and to study a particular subject without considering these implications can be a sterile--and in extreme cases hazardous--exercise. The urge and ability to ponder such questions as the meaning of life distinguish human beings from the other animals. In an increasingly complex world&#44; in which traditional values are often called into question&#44; students of the College are encouraged to reflect upon their own assumptions as well as the assumptions of other times and cultures. In these upper-division Philosophy and Values courses students in the College will be encouraged to ponder the types of questions that will enhance their ability to understand their heritage&#44; their contemporaries&#44; and themselves.

Students develop a better understanding of the similarities and differences in traditional values in three East Asian cultures by comparing how canonical texts of premodern China&#44; Japan and Korea represent romantic relationship. They explore how these values sometimes provide a given framework for a narrative and sometimes provide the definition of transgressive acts. This is followed by the study of several contemporary East Asian films&#44; giving the student the opportunity to explore how traditional values persist&#44; change&#44; or become nexus points of resistance in the complicated modern and post-modern milieu of East Asian cultures maintaining a national identity while exercising an international presence.

Education (EDUC),241C,Narrative across Learning Contexts,3 Units,Education,Graduate,Fall and spring,Letter grade. Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Lecture per week for 15 weeks. ,The study of narrative has solidified into an important body of literature that is of particular relevance to educators. Across learning contexts&#44; narrative is a ubiquitous literacy tool&#44; and as such&#44; it underlies many learning activities. We tell narratives for their potency to explain&#44; rationalize&#44; and delineate past&#44; present&#44; and possible experience. This narrative act is a collaborative undertaking&#44; co-told and designed with the audience's input&#44; addressing an audience's present and future concerns. Narrative can thus potentially create shared understandings and community among those participating in narrative activity&#44; yet narratives can become sites for rejection and contestation. Narrative is also a socializing tool. The course will also address methodological approaches to the study of narrative that are relevant to the field of education. Students enrolled in this course are expected to collect narrative samples from naturally occurring interactions (video and audio-taped conversation&#44; classroom interaction)&#44; written narrative texts&#44; or other.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,5 hours of Lecture per week for 3 weeks. ,This course examines the nature&#44; function and status in contemporary American culture of a central metaphor and belief in American experience: human life as a journey to the west&#44; to the east&#44; or to nowhere. We will study the nature and extent of this motif in recent American culture (including its expression in literature&#44; music&#44; and popular idioms) as well as situate our discussions within the context of historical expressions of the American journey as cyclical&#44; eschatological&#44; or as a journey to oblivion. Drawing on selections from&#44; among others&#44; Walt Whitman&#44; Josiah Royce&#44; James Baldwin&#44; Jack Kerouac&#44; and Maya Angelou&#44; we will discuss the notion of journey in terms of possibility&#44; nostalgia&#44; nectar&#44; cynicism&#44; self-deception&#44; and disappointment. Students will be encouraged to consider--and write about--their own relation to this expressive tradition in American cultural history.

American Studies (AMERSTD),183E,The Woman's Frontier,1 Unit,American Studies,Undergraduate,Summer,Letter grade. Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,5 hours of Lecture per week for 3 weeks. ,Westward expansion and the frontier experience have long assumed a mythical status as formative events in the annals of American culture&#44; providing Americans with a collective cultural history and space for fantasy. Within this story there has been little room for women: westward expansion has been encoded as a male activity&#44; and the American West has served a proving ground for the definition of American manhood. However&#44; recent research on frontier women's history has shown that white and non-white women were present on all frontiers and in all phases of American expansion to the West. Moreover&#44; white&#44; literate women wrote copiously in&#44; on&#44; and about western frontiers--in letters and diaries&#44; travel and settlement narratives&#44; reminiscences and autobiographies&#44; poems&#44; stories&#44; and novels. Reading from a diversity of women's texts&#44; we will explore gender together with race and class in order to understand the women's frontier. This course will roughly follow a chronological line from the 1830s into the first decades of the 20th century.
Political Science (POL SCI),POL SCI 284,Strategies of Contemporary Governance,4 Units,Political Science,Graduate,Fall and spring,Letter grade. Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,2 to 3 hours of Seminar per week for 15 weeks. ,This course explores the implications of new strategies for coping with social problems and managing public programs. In response to growing criticism of government bureaucracy&#44; public skepticism of expert authority&#44; and an explosion of advocacy groups&#44; a variety of new governance strategies have been developed. These new strategies are characterized by five broad themes: the use of markets or market mechanisms to increase efficiency; an emphasis on holding public agencies accountable and making them more transparent; the development of coordinating networks to link public agencies with each other and with stakeholders; the extensive involvement of non-state organizations in all aspects of governing; and renewed attention to the civic role of individuals and communities. The course investigates the extent to which these new strategies succeed in making the governance process more efficient&#44; accountable&#44; effective&#44; representative&#44; and civic.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,5 hours of Lecture per week for 3 weeks. ,American society is fragmented&#44; divided&#44; and often polarized. Race&#44; class&#44; and at times culture serve as boundaries which separate and reinforce distinctions&#44; creating many different Americas within the U.S. How one sees America tends to be intimately related to the environment in which one lives&#44; the social status and class one occupies&#44; and the historical experience of the individual or the group with which one identifies. Yet&#44; there are also forces which bind Americans together and which have produced a culture that transcends various forms of difference to create a common American identity. This course will explore the nature of those forces that divide and unite the peoples of the U.S. Through literature&#44; film&#44; and social science&#44; we will attempt to identify the ingredients of the glue that holds this society together and gives the concept of America meaning.

Alongside these conceptual upheavals we will look at the evolving structure of the discipline&#44; its links with industry and government&#44; and the massive transformations of the Second World War&#44; culminating in the atomic bomb. In the postwar period we will deal with the conceptual consolidation of the modern physical worldview and the emergence of "big science" in alliance with the state.

Architecture (ARCH),212,Body-Conscious Design: Shoes&#44; Chairs&#44; Rooms&#44; and Beyond,3 Units,Architecture,Graduate,Fall and spring,Letter grade. Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Seminar per week for 15 weeks. ,This seminar prepares students to evaluate and design environments from the point of view of how they interact with the human body. Tools and clothing modify that interaction. Semi-fixed features of the near environment&#44; especially furniture&#44; may have greater impact on physical well being and social-psychological comfort than fixed features like walls&#44; openings&#44; and volume. Today&#44; designers can help redefine and legitimize new attitudes toward supporting the human body by&#44; for example&#44; designing for a wide range of postural alternatives and possibly designing new kinds of furniture. At the urban design scale&#44; the senses of proprioception and kinesthetics can be used to shape architecture and landscape architecture. This course covers these topics with special emphasis on chair design and evaluation. The public health implications of a new attitude toward posture and back support are explored. The course heightens students' consciousness of their own and others' physical perceptions through weekly experiential exercises. Students produce three design exercises: shoe&#44; chair&#44; and a room interior.

At the junction of landform&#44; infrastructure&#44; urban design&#44; and architecture lies a rich field of possibilities that is increasingly superseding the narrower field of each of the disciplines by themselves. In the past century&#44; contemporary culture and technology-automobiles&#44; televisions&#44; cell phones&#44; and the internet have socially&#44; culturally&#44; environmentally&#44; and physically reshaped the urban fabric&#44; calling into question the very definition of urbanity. The course will explore the implications for public space in an era of increased security and risk mitigation and how designers may direct the various invisible forces which give form to the world around us.

Qualified students may select to take this course pass/not pass. ,3 hours of Seminar per week for 15 weeks. ,This exploratory seminar addresses a secret life of buildings related to physical performance. Students examine architectural&#44; lighting&#44; and mechanical systems in existing buildings with attention to energy use&#44; occupant well-being&#44; and architectural spacemaking. The seminar applies a collection of measurement techniques&#44; often involving novel approaches&#44; to reveal operating patterns in the complex environment of contemporary buildings. The personal experience students gain in performing the evaluations contributes to the students' experiential base at a formative time. Analysis of data collected in the field and the comparison of these data to values given by simulation tools provides a foundation for understanding the more abstract tools and standards used by designers in practice. The juxtaposition of design intention and post-occupancy performance can be a powerful learning experience now&#44; as well as preparation for evaluating building performance in the future.

What are the implications of living in a "global world" for educational systems? In this course&#44; we explore these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization.

In the final part of the course&#44; we examine topics including language policy&#44; technology&#44; and strategies to combat educational inequality. To explore these topics&#44; we will read and discuss case studies from Asia&#44; Africa&#44; Latin America&#44; and the United States to provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the context and content of education internationally.
