LIVE DEPLOYMENT AND REPO
========================

Public Repo:
https://github.com/DanielKoohmarey/ThinkAhead.git

Tentative Live Deployment via Heroku:

====================
CONFIGURING DATABASE
====================	    

	The databases run in Postgres and not Django's default SQLite. 
	To run it locally, you have to create the database locally and sync it. 

	0) Install postgres
	   a) Download postgres:
	      sudo apt-get postgres
	   b) Download the adaptor, psycopg:
	      sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
	      or try it manually:
	      http://initd.org/psycopg/install/
	   c) Install the library
	      pip install djorm-ext-pgarray
	      pip install djorm-ext-expressions
	   d) Change thinkahead/settings.py so that you comment DATABASE that is configured to SQLlite and uncomment DATABASE that is congigured to postgres

	1) Create a user for postgres
	   a) Type "su - postgres" in the terminal should ask you for authentication. If your password doesnt pass several times, you might have to overwrite your password by typing "sudo passwd postgres"
	   b) In Postgres' prompt, type "createuser <yourusername>". If it asks if you want to be the superuser, just type yes
	   c) exit by typing "exit" in Postgres' prompt

	2) Create a database
	   a) In the terminal, type "createdb darsplus"
	   b) In the project directory, type "python manage.py syncdb". It shouldn't be an issue but you might have to change DATABASE settings like 'host', 'username' and 'password' to fit your database

	3) Manually add entries to DB (Just in case)
	   To manually add the entries, type "python manage.py loaddata darsplus/fixtures/initial_data.json"
	   If successful, you should see "XXX objects installed out of XXX fixtures"



===============================
SETTING UP: LOCAL VERSUS HEROKU
===============================

      By default the settings.py are set to work locally. In the case that it got pushed to a heroku setting, there are two things that you need to change

      0) Open thinkahead/wsgi.py. Comment the part that is for Heroku (should have a comment) and uncomment the other one
      
      1) Go to thinkahead/settings.py. At the very bottom, there shold be a chunk of a code with the header "The lines that follow configure Heroku". Uncomment that (Mainly to change the DATABASES setting)



=============
RUNNING TESTS
=============

	All test files and/or directories should reside within darsplus/tests/

	0) Running the whole test suites:
	   "python manage.py test"

	1) Running a specific test:
	   "python manage.py test darsplus.tests.<python file name>"
	   e.g.
	   "python manage.py test darsplus.tests.testColleges"
	   "python manage.py test darsplus.tests.testCourses"



================
RUNNING COVERAGE
================
	
	Coverage is a module/package that tests your spread of test (I think). Requried for submission

	0) Check your Django version, should update to 1.6.2
	   
	   a) Do the following in Python:
	      >import django
	      >django.VERSION

	   b) If you have the latest one, go to next step. Otherwise, do 
	      "sudo pip install -U Django"
	      and check your version again. Should be updated

	1) Download coverage.py at
	   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage

	2) unzip it and in the terminal run "sudo python setup.py install"

	3) To run coverage, do the following on the directory that has manage.py:
	   coverage run --source='.' manage.py test darsplus

	4) In the terminal, do this to present it in a better way
	   coverage report
