CONFIGURING DATABASE
	    
	    The databases run in Postgres and not Django's default SQLite. 
	    To run it locally, you have to create the database locally and sync it. 

	    0) Install postgres
	       a) Download postgres...somehow. should be:
	          sudo apt-get postgres
	       b) Download the adaptor, psycopg:
	       	  sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
	       	  or try it manually:
		  http://initd.org/psycopg/install/
	       c) Install the library
	       	  pip install djorm-ext-pgarray
		  pip install djorm-ext-expressions
	       d) Change thinkahead/settings.py so that you comment DATABASE that is configured to SQLlite and uncomment DATABASE that is congigured to postgres

	    1) Create a user for postgres
	       a) Type "su - postgres" in the terminal should ask you for authentication. If your password doesnt pass several times, you might have to overwrite your password by typing "sudo passwd postgres"
	       b) In Postgres' prompt, type "createuser <yourusername>". If it asks if you want to be the superuser, just type yes
	       c) exit by typing "exit" in Postgres' prompt
	    2) Create a database
	       a) In the terminal, type "createdb darsplus"
	       b) In the project directory, type "python manage.py syncdb". It shouldn't be an issue but you might have to change DATABASE settings like 'host', 'username' and 'password' to fit your database
	    3) Manually add entries to DB (Just in case)
	       To manually add the entries, type "python manage.py loaddata darsplus/fixtures/initial_data.json"
	       If successful, you should see "XXX objects installed out of XXX fixtures"

====
LOCAL VERSUS HEROKU

      By default the settings.py are set to work locally. In the case that it got pushed to a heroku setting, there are two things that you need to change

      0) Open thinkahead/wsgi.py. Comment the part that is for Heroku (should have a comment) and uncomment the other one
      
      1) Go to thinkahead/settings.py. At the very bottom, there shold be a chunk of a code with the header "The lines that follow configure Heroku". Uncomment that
